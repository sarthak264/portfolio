      <p>
        I'm a passionate front-end developer driven by the desire to craft
        exceptional digital experiences that are both engaging and accessible.
        My journey began with a deep fascination for transforming design
        concepts into functional and user-centric realities. This passion led me
        to hone my expertise in HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.js, allowing me
        to translate ideas into dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

        Throughout my academic journey and professional experiences at Growth99
        and Rapca Infotech Pvt. Ltd., I've consistently pursued opportunities to
        combine my technical skills with my design sensibilities.
